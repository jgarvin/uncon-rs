# uncon [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

Traits for **un**checked **con**versions between types in Rust.

## Changes

Separate changlogs are available for
[`uncon`](https://github.com/nvzqz/uncon-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and
[`uncon_derive`](https://github.com/nvzqz/uncon-rs/blob/master/derive/CHANGELOG.md).

Although they may differ in version number, `uncon_derive` is always compatible
with current major version of `uncon`.
